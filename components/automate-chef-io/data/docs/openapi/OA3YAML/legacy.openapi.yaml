        This is used by chef-server, it requests a GET /data-collector/v0 to
        check

        Automate's status.

        We proxy /data-collector/v0 to /api/v0/events/data-collector, so this is

        where we need to respond.

        Since this is for legacy-support only, we don't bother much about having

        google.protobuf.Empty as argument.
