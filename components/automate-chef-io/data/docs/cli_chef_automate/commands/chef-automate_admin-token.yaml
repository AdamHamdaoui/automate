  Generate an admin token for use against the Automate API.

  You can pass token with the "api-token" header. For example, you could query
  for all existing auth policies with curl:

    curl -H "api-token: <YOUR_TOKEN>" <AUTOMATE_FQDN>/api/v0/auth/policies

  The admin API token has access to the entire Automate API. With great power
  comes great responsibility. Keep it secret, keep it safe.
